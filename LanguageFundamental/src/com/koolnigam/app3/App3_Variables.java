Instance Variable:-
1. if the value of variable is varied from object to object then we should have to create Instance variable
2. for instance variable every object have seperate copy
3. instance variable will be created at the time of object creation and destroyed at the time of object destruction
4. instance variable will be declared inside class but outside of method,block,contructor 
5. for instance variable JVM will perform default value
6. to use instance variable we must have to use with class object
7. instance variable can be access directly from non-static area but can't be access directly from static area we should have to make 
   object for that
   
Static Variable:-
1. if the value of variable is not varied from object to object then we should have to create Static variable
2. for Static variable every object have ony copy
3. Static variable will be created at the time of class loading destroyed at the time of class unloading
4. Static variable will be declared inside class but outside of method,block,contructor 
5. for Static variable JVM will perform default value
6. to use Static variable we can use it with class name or object also
7. Static variable can be access directly from both static and non-static area 

Local Variable:-
1. local variable are those which we will use just for temporary purpose
2. local variable are those which are declared inside method,block,constructor and not in class
3. for local variable JVM won't provide default value
4. local variable must be initialize before using them 
5. don't declare local variable inside logical block coz there is no gurantee of executing that block
5. for local variable the only applicable modifier is final only public,private,protected,static,volatile,transient it is not valid
   p s v m(String[] args){
   final int a = 10;     ---> valid
   public int a = 10;    ---> invalid
   private int a = 10;   ---> invalid
   protected int a = 10; ---> invalid
   static int a = 10;    ---> invalid
   transient int a = 10; ---> invalid
   }
