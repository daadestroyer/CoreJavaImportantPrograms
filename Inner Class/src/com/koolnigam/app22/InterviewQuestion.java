Q.1 What id inner classes ? In which version of java it came ?
Q.2 In how many ways we can create Inner classes ? What are the types of Inner classes ?
Q.3 Explain normal or regular inner class ? With example ? []
Q.4 Why creation on static members inside inner class is not allow ?
=====
Ans:- 
Creation of static members inside inner class is not possible because without creation object of outer class Inner class object creation isn't allow so if inner class member declare static then we
can access with name so to prevent this static members inside inner class are not allow
===== 
Q.5 How to access inner class code from Outer class static area(main method) ? [APP4]
Q.6 How to access inner class code from Outer class non-static area(without main) ? [APP5]
Q.7 How to access inner class code from Outside of Outer class area ? [APP6]
Q.8 Inside inner class can we access static,non-static,private,non-private members of outer class directly or not ? --> yes we can [APP7]

>>> Within in inner class this always refers to current inner class object , we can use current outer class object by this OuterClassName.this.variablename 

Q.9 What are the applicable modifier for top level class and Inner level class ? 
Q.10 Give Example of nesting of normal inner class [APP9]
Q.11 Explain method local inner class ? With example ? 
Q.12 What is the main objective of method local inner class ?
Q.13 We can access method local inner class from that class only in which inside method inner class is created i.e outside of that method in which class is created  we can't access it is true or not ? 
Q.14 We can declare method local inner class inside static or non static method both ? 
Q.15 If we are declaring method local inner class as non-static then we can access static and non static member of outer class directly
Q.16 If we are declaring method local inner class as static then we can access static member directly but not non static member of outer class directly
Q.17 Explain anonymous inner class ? With example ?
Q.18 What are the purpose of anonymous inner class ? 
Q.19 How many types of anonymous inner class ?
Q.20 Give example of anonymous inner class that extends class ?
Q.21 Inside anonymous class we can declare parent class overrided method and child newly created method also but we can't call child newly created method because by using parent refrence we can't call
     child class method so its true or not ---> yes true
     
Q.22 Give example of anonymous inner class in which Define a thread by extending Thread class ?
Q.23 Give example of anonymous inner class that implements interface ?
Q.24 Give example of anonymous inner class that define inside method arguments ?
Q.25 Difference b/w normal java class and anonymous inner class ?
Q.26 What is static nested class ? Give example of static nested class ? Static nested class and Outer class having what type of association (week or strong) ?
Q.27 In normal regular inner class we can access static and non-static member of outer class directly by in static nested class we can access static member of outer 
     class directly and can't access instance member directly it is true or not ? ---> TRUE
Q.28 We can't declare static member(main method also) inside normal inner class but in static nested class we can it is true not not ? ---> TRUE
Q.28 Difference b/w normal/regular inner class and static nested class ?
Q.30 Give example to show that how we can make interface inside class and other class can implement that interface ? 
Q.31 Give example to show that how we can make interface inside interface ?
